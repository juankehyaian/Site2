				<p>The story behind the Adidas Samba "Pony Wales Bonner" is the result of a collaboration between British designer Grace Wales Bonner and Adidas Originals, which began in 2020. The collaboration takes the classic Samba silhouette, originally designed for soccer in the 1950s, and reinterprets it with Bonner's unique aesthetic, which blends cultural influences, luxurious materials, and handcrafted details, resulting in highly sought-after models like the "Pony" with synthetic fur on the instep. The price is approximately $557.</p>
