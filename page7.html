				<p>The story of the 2011 Nike Mag begins with its appearance in the film Back to the Future Part II, designed by Tinker Hatfield and Tiffany Beers. In 2011, Nike released 1,500 pairs of this replica for auction on eBay, with proceeds benefiting the Michael J. Fox Foundation, though they lacked the self-lacing technology seen in the film. These shoes, which lit up and had a rechargeable battery, were a significant milestone, representing a futuristic model that finally became a reality and laying the groundwork for future releases. The approximate price is $19,450.</p>
